# BetaVolume <img src="man/figures/logo_2.png" align="right" height="137" />

The goal of BetaVolume is to provides a new measure of beta diversity based on the geometric embedding of metacommunities. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of BetaVolume from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("clsong/betavolume")
```

## Example

Here we show a basic example of this package. 
```{r warning=F, message=F}
library(BetaVolume)
library(tidyverse)
```

We analyze an empirical metacommunity collected collected by A. H. Gentry and numerous additional collectors. This metacommunity has 37 species and 10 patches.

```{r data_glance}
head(example_meta_composition)
```

As this data only contains information of presence/absence of species, we adopt the duplication schemes to compute hypervolume beta diversity. The hypervolume beta diversity of this metacommunity is
```{r warning=F}
betavolume(example_meta_composition, weights = T)
```

We can disentangle the individual contribution of a patch to the overall beta diversity. We find that 
```{r warning=F}
disentangle_individual_contribution(example_meta_composition, weights = T) %>% 
  enframe(name = "species", value = 'contribution') %>% 
  arrange(-contribution)
```
